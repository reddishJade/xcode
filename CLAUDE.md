Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them; don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No flexibility or configurability that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it; don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports, variables, and functions that your changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" -> "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass."
- "Fix the bug" -> "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass."
- "Refactor X" -> "Ensure tests pass before and after."

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
3. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria such as "make it work" require clarification.

These guidelines are working if there are fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions happen before implementation mistakes.

## 5. Commit Style

All git commits must follow a structured, descriptive, and unified commit message format.
Prefer one small, verifiable git checkpoint per completed implementation step, and stage
only the intended files.

### Format:
```text
[type]: [one-line short title describing major feature in lowercase and imperative]

[1-2 paragraph description explaining context, rationale, and impact of changes, focusing on text search first.]

Key changes:

- [List of file changes and brief description of change, grouped by component or file]
```

## 6. Comments and Docstrings

Maintain absolute simplicity and professional factuality in all code comments and docstrings.

### Rules:
1. **Simplified Chinese**: Runtime comments, inline notes, and docstrings must be written in Simplified Chinese (简体中文).
2. **Restrained and Factual**: Comments must focus strictly on facts, technical logic, or constraints. Avoid teaching-demo wording, marketing claims, or assertions of "production-grade" capability.
